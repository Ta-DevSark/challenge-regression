# challenge-regression

## Description

This repository, **challenge-regression**, is a consolidation project that was completed by a team of 4 individuals. The challenge involved applying linear regression in a real-world context and preparing a dataset for machine learning. The objective was to predict real estate prices for sales in Belgium. The project had a duration of 4 days, with a code submission deadline on 02/05/2023 at 16:00.

## Usage

All the necessary steps have been successfully completed to create a machine learning model for real estate price prediction. Here's a summary of the accomplished tasks:

### Step 1: Data Cleaning

- Duplicate entries have been removed from the dataset.
- Missing values (NANs) have been handled effectively.
- Text data has been excluded from the analysis.
- Features with strong correlations have been eliminated.

### Step 2: Data Formatting

- The dataset has been divided into training and testing sets (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test).

### Step 3: Model Selection

- Data analysis led to the selection of suitable machine learning models.

### Step 4: Apply Your Model

- The selected model has been successfully implemented and applied to the data.

### Step 5: Model Evaluation

- The model's accuracy has been evaluated and results have been obtained.
- Consideration has been given to potential improvements, and an assessment of the most impactful process steps has been made.
- Insights on time allocation for similar projects have been documented.

### Step 6: Presentation

- A professional presentation with an appealing design has been prepared.
- The results have been presented within the 5-minute timeframe, adhering to the guideline of not showing code or Jupyter notebooks.
- All team members actively participated in the presentation.
