# Regression

- Repository: `challenge-regression`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `4 days`
- Deadline: `02/05/2023 16:00` **(code)**
- Team challenge : 4

## Learning objectives

- Be able to apply a linear regression in a real context.
- Be able to preprocess data for machine learning.

## The Mission

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" asks you to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales.

Take the dataset that was previously **scraped**, **preprocessed** and **analyzed**.
Preprocess the data to be used with machine learning.

- You have to handle NANs.
- You have to handle categorical data.
- You have to select features.
- You have to remove features that have too strong correlation.

### Must-have features

#### Step 1 : Data cleaning

You have collected your data, you have cleaned and analyzed it a first time!
So it's time to do some machine learning with it!

But first, we have to prepare the data for machine learning.

- No duplicates.
- No NANs.
- No text data.
- No features that have too strong correlation between them.

#### Step 2: Data formatting

Now that the dataset is ready, you have to format it for machine learning:

- Divide your dataset for training and testing. (`X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test`)

#### Step 3: Model selection

The dataset is ready. Now let's select a model.

Look at which models make the most sense according to your data.

#### Step 4: Apply your model

Apply your model on your data.

#### Step 5: Model evaluation

Let's evaluate your model. Which accuracy did you reach?
Try to answer those questions:

- How could you improve this result?
- Which part of the process has the most impact on the results?
- How should you divide your time working on this kind of project?

#### Step 4: Presentation

Present your results in front of the group.

- You have to make a nice presentation **with a professional design**.
- You have **5 minutes** to present (without Q&A). **You can't use more time**, **you can't use less time**.
- **Everyone has to talk** during the presentation.
- You **CAN'T show code or jupyter notebook** during the presentation.

## Constraints

### Code style

- Each **function or class** has to be **typed**
- Each **function or class** has to contain a **docstring**
- Your code should be **formatted** with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).
- Your code should be **commented** when necessary.
- Your code should be **cleaned of any commented unused code**.

## Deliverables

1. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)
2. Present your results in front of the group in **5mins max**.

### Steps

1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
